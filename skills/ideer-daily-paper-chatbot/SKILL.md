# iDeer Daily Paper Chatbot

Use this skill when the user wants the iDeer daily-paper workflow but does not want the repo to call its own LLM API. The chatbot should do the reading, scoring, grouping, report writing, and idea generation directly in the current conversation.

For a Codex-user walkthrough, see [references/codex-tutorial.md](references/codex-tutorial.md).

## Core rule

Keep as much of the original iDeer workflow as possible:

- reuse the repo layout
- reuse the source fetchers when they work
- reuse `.env`, `profiles/description.txt`, and `profiles/researcher_profile.md`
- reuse `history/` as the artifact destination when saving outputs

But do **not** rely on `main.py` for any step that requires `MODEL_NAME`, `BASE_URL`, `API_KEY`, or Ollama. Instead, fetch raw items and have the chatbot perform the intelligence layer.

## What stays the same

- source defaults and source-selection heuristics
- profile-driven filtering using `profiles/description.txt`
- optional stronger report/ideas guidance from `profiles/researcher_profile.md`
- artifact validation in `history/`
- optional SMTP sending when the user explicitly wants live email and SMTP config exists
- Codex automation support for recurring runs

## What changes

Replace these original in-repo LLM tasks with chatbot work in-session:

- per-item Chinese summary
- per-item relevance scoring
- per-source daily summary
- cross-source narrative report
- research idea generation

Do not call `python main.py` or `bash scripts/run_daily.sh` unless the user explicitly wants to test the original API-based pipeline. For chatbot-first runs, fetch raw data with the repo's fetchers or with web browsing and continue in the conversation.

## Files to inspect first

Always check:

- `.env`
- `profiles/description.txt`

Check when needed:

- `profiles/researcher_profile.md`
- `profiles/x_accounts.txt`

If `.env` does not exist, copy from `.env.example`. Do not invent secrets.

## Modes

Map the user request to one of these modes:

- **Chatbot dry run**: fetch sources, summarize in-chat, save markdown/html/json artifacts, do not send email
- **Chatbot full digest**: fetch sources, summarize in-chat, save artifacts, send email only if SMTP config is complete and the user asked for live send
- **Setup/fix**: adjust `.env`, profiles, categories, or fetchers so source collection works
- **Recurring automation**: create or update a Codex automation that performs a chatbot-first digest

## Source defaults

- Default paper sources: `arxiv semanticscholar huggingface`
- Add `github` only when the user wants code/repo signals
- Add `twitter` only when the user explicitly wants social signals and credentials exist
- For Hugging Face, default to papers only
- For CS users, start arXiv from `cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG`; expand to `cs.CV cs.RO` for embodied, spatial, or robotics interests
- Prefer explicit Semantic Scholar queries when the profile is broad

## Chatbot-first pipeline

### Step 1: Classify and configure

Read the profile and decide:

- which sources to fetch
- whether report and idea generation are requested
- whether email is requested
- whether the request is one-off or recurring

Use [references/presets.md](references/presets.md) for presets.

### Step 2: Fetch raw items

Prefer the repo fetchers first when the repo is available:

- `fetchers/arxiv_fetcher.py`
- `fetchers/huggingface_fetcher.py`
- `fetchers/semanticscholar_fetcher.py`
- `fetchers/github_fetcher.py`
- `fetchers/twitter_fetcher.py`

If the repo is not available or a fetcher is broken, use browsing and cite the public source pages.

Fetch raw candidates only. Do not call the repo's LLM scoring path.

### Step 3: Deduplicate and curate

The chatbot should:

- remove duplicates across sources when the same paper appears in HF and arXiv
- score relevance qualitatively or numerically in the conversation
- organize results by the user's stated interest directions
- write concise Chinese summaries and recommendation reasons

When the user gave explicit directions such as `Agent / Spatial Intelligence / World Model`, preserve those headings in the final digest.

### Step 4: Save artifacts in iDeer-compatible places

Prefer these output shapes:

- `history/<source>/<date>/<date>.md` for source-level markdown digests
- `history/reports/<date>/report.md` for cross-source report
- `history/ideas/<date>/ideas.json` for structured idea output
- optional `history/<source>/<date>/<source>_email.html` if you render an HTML email body

It is acceptable for chatbot-first runs to write fewer files than the original pipeline, as long as you report exactly what was written.

If the user wants HTML artifacts without touching the main repo scripts, use the bundled renderer:

```bash
python skills/ideer-daily-paper-chatbot/scripts/render_chatbot_artifacts.py \
  --date YYYY-MM-DD \
  --base-dir <artifact-dir>
```

This script should render `report.html` and `digest_email.html` from chatbot-written markdown/json outputs inside the chosen artifact directory.

For step-by-step Codex usage examples, read [references/codex-tutorial.md](references/codex-tutorial.md).

### Step 5: Email behavior

If SMTP is incomplete, do not claim that email was sent. Save the digest locally and tell the user what is missing.

If SMTP is complete and the user explicitly asked for sending, either:

- reuse the repo's email templates/utilities if convenient, or
- render a simple HTML body and send it through SMTP

Never send email on the first validation run unless the user clearly asked for a live send.

### Step 6: Recurring automation

For chatbot-first automation, prefer Codex automation over cron. Use the repo root as the working directory and write the prompt so the chatbot fetches raw source items, performs summarization itself, saves artifacts, and only sends email if SMTP exists.

See [references/automation.md](references/automation.md).

## Safe command patterns

Use small fetch/test commands instead of the full original pipeline.

Examples:

```bash
.venv/bin/python - <<'PY'
from fetchers.huggingface_fetcher import get_daily_papers
print(len(get_daily_papers(10)))
PY
```

```bash
.venv/bin/python - <<'PY'
from fetchers.arxiv_fetcher import fetch_papers_for_categories
print(fetch_papers_for_categories(['cs.AI','cs.LG'], max_entries=25, sleep_range=(0,0)).keys())
PY
```

Use `bash scripts/run_daily.sh` only to debug the legacy API-based path.

## Validation checklist

After each run, report:

- the date that actually ran
- which sources were fetched
- whether summarization was done by the chatbot or by the repo pipeline
- which files were created
- whether email was sent, skipped, or blocked
- the first concrete blocker if anything failed

## Safety rules

- Never print API keys, SMTP passwords, or tokens
- Never claim files exist before checking them
- Never claim email was sent before checking SMTP success
- Do not overwrite user-authored profile files unless the user asked
- Prefer writing additive chatbot-first artifacts over changing core repo code unless a fetcher is actually broken

## Good default

For users who want paper digestion without API keys, start with:

- raw fetch from `arxiv` and `huggingface`
- chatbot-written markdown digest
- optional chatbot-written cross-source report
- no live email on the first pass
